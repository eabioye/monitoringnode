Working Title: Designing a Self-Sustaining, Ultra-Low-Power Environmental Monitoring Node for Remote Locations 

Project Synopsis: 
This project challenges Electrical Engineering students to design and build an autonomous IoT device that monitors environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity, light intensity) in remote or harsh environments. The device will be entirely self-sustaining, relying on solar panels and energy storage for power, and will transmit data wirelessly to a central domain. The project emphasizes power management, circuit design, and wireless communication on a surface mount electronics.

System Requirements and Specifications: 
Define specific environmental parameters to be monitored, data transmission frequency, and desired battery life. Research typical weather patterns and solar radiation levels at the target deployment location. 

Power System Design: 
Select appropriate solar panels, batteries/capacitors, and power management ICs. Design and simulate the power harvesting, storage, and regulation circuits. Consider maximum power point tracking (MPPT) for optimal solar panel efficiency. 

Sensor and Signal Conditioning Circuits: 
Select sensors for the chosen environmental parameters. Design analog and digital circuits for sensor interfacing, signal amplification, filtering, and analog-to-digital conversion.

Wireless Communication System: 
Choose a suitable low-power wireless communication protocol (e.g., IC2, LoRa, Zigbee). Design the RF transmitter and receiver circuits or select appropriate modules.

Microcontroller and Firmware: 
Select a low-power microcontroller for data acquisition, system control, and communication. Develop firmware to collect sensor data, manage power, and transmit data wirelessly. 

PCB Design and Fabrication: 
Design the printed circuit board (PCB) layout, paying attention to power and signal integrity. Fabricate and assemble the PCB.

System Integration and Testing: 
Integrate all components and test the system's functionality in a controlled environment. Conduct field tests to validate system performance in real-world conditions.
